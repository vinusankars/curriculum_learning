Thanks to https://github.com/GuyHacohen/curriculum_learning for the open-sourced code framework.
we use the same scripts used for "On The Power of Curriculum Learning in Training Deep Networks" by Hacohen et al. (ICML, 2019)

To run experiments, clone the above GitHub repository and replace the scripts
main_reproduce_paper.py and main_train_networks.py with the scripts given here.
Also, make a results/ folder at the same location where the results will be saved.
